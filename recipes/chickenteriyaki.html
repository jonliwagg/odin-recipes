        <h3>Chicken Karaage Recipe</h3>

        <p>Teriyaki is derived from the Japanese root words teri, to shine, and yaki, to broil or grill. That’s the way traditional teriyaki looks: shiny and incised with grill marks.</p>
        <p>In Japan, teriyaki is a mix of soy sauce, sake and the rice wine mirin, which imparts a subtle sweetness. </p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>    
                <li>1 ½ teaspoons brown sugar</li>
                <li>6 cloves garlic, crushed in a press</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1 3-inch cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon pineapple juice</li>
                <li>8 skinless, boneless chicken thighs</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            </ul>

                
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small saucepan, combine all ingredients except cornstarch and chicken. Bring to boil over high heat. 
                    Reduce heat to low and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. 

                    Remove from heat and let cool. Discard cinnamon stick and mix in 1/2 cup water.</li>
                <li>Place chicken in a heavy-duty sealable plastic bag. Add soy sauce mixture, seal bag, and turn to coat chicken.
                    Refrigerate for at least an hour, ideally overnight.</li>

                <li>Remove chicken and set aside. Pour mixture into a small saucepan. 
                    Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to low. 
                    Mix cornstarch with 2 tablespoons water and add to pan. 
                    Stir until mixture begins to thicken, and gradually stir in enough water (about 1/2 cup) until sauce is the consistency of heavy cream. 
                    Remove from heat and set aside.</li>

                <li>Preheat a broiler or grill. Lightly brush chicken pieces on all sides with sauce, and broil or grill about 3 minutes per side. 
                    While chicken is cooking, place sauce over high heat and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a bare simmer, adding water a bit at a time to keep mixture at a pourable consistency.
                     To serve, slice chicken into strips, arrange on plates, and drizzle with sauce.</li>
            </ol>
